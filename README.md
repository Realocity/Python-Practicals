## Lab Practice - Implementation of Python Programs

### We love Programming. Our aim with this course is to create a love for Programming.

  <summary>:zap: Running A Python Program</summary>
  <br/>

Excellent, now you have all the tools required
to run a Python program on the command line.

As an illustration,
I will use my simple Python script
[``export-kobo``](https://github.com/pettarin/export-kobo/),
which reads annotations and highlights
from the database file of a Kobo eReader device (``KoboReader.sqlite``),
and prints them on the prompt or exports them to an output file.

### Step 1: Download The Source Code

First, download the source code of the Python program you want to run.

This usually implies **downloading** either **a single Python source code** file
(with extension ``.py``), or **a ZIP file containing several Python source code files**
and other resource files that you need to uncompress somewhere on your disk.

The exact details depend on your Python program,
hence be sure to **carefully read its install documentation**.
You can download the prescribed files with your browser,
and then copy/uncompress them using the Windows graphical file manager.

In our example, we download the raw file
[``export-kobo.py``](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pettarin/export-kobo/master/export-kobo.py)
from the GitHub repository.

Remember **Safety Rule 3**
("copy your Python files into a separate folder")?

We put the downloaded ``export-kobo.py`` file
in a new folder ``C:\export-kobo``:

![Running a Python program](imgs/130_example.png)

Note that we also copied
the ``KoboReader.sqlite`` file
(the input of our Python program)
from our Kobo eReader
to the same folder.

### Step 2: Open A Command Prompt And ``cd`` There

Then, open a Command Prompt as explained above,
and change the current working directory to the folder
where you put your Python program source files.

In our example, ``cd C:\export-kobo``:

![Running a Python program](imgs/130_example.png)

A simpler alternative to using the ``cd`` command
takes advantages of the Windows file explorer.
Just navigate the file explorer to the folder
where your Python code is:

![Opening a prompt from file explorer](imgs/140_opendir.png)

and select the
``File > Open command prompt > Open command prompt``
menu:

![Opening a prompt from file explorer](imgs/141_opendir.png)

you will get a new Command Prompt window,
already located at the correct directory:

![Opening a prompt from file explorer](imgs/142_opendir.png)

### Step 3: Run The Python Program

At this point, we are ready to run our program.

Type ``python export-kobo.py KoboReader.sqlite --list`` and hit Enter/Return:

![Running a Python program](imgs/131_example.png)

The Python interpreter will load our ``export-kobo.py`` program,
and run it with arguments ``KoboReader.sqlite`` and ``--list``.

Clearly, **the semantics of the arguments vary from program to program**,
depending on what each program is supposed to do.

In our case, ``export-kobo.py`` will read the file
whose name is passed as the first parameter (``KoboReader.sqlite``)
and it will list (``--list`` option) the titles of all the eBooks
with annotations or highlights in the database.

If we specify different command arguments, for example
``python export-kobo.py KoboReader.sqlite --csv --output exported.csv``,
we will get a different behavior:

![Running a Python program](imgs/132_example.png)

In particular, this second command exported all the information
contained in the ``KoboReader.sqlite`` file into
the newly created file named ``exported.csv`` in CSV format:

![Running a Python program](imgs/133_example.png)

You must **check the documentation** of your Python program
to know the semantics of its arguments.

Usually, if you run a Python program without arguments
you will get a synopsis of the accepted arguments:

![Running without arguments shows the synopsis](imgs/150_help.png)

If a ``-h`` or ``--help`` argument is given,
then a more verbose help message will be printed:

![Running with -h shows an help message](imgs/151_help.png)




**Congratulations, now you should be able
to download and run a Python program on your own!**

## Usage
  
How do I run a Python script that I downloaded from GitHub?
Download python installer from their official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After installing, open the folder where you have downloaded the script, press and hold shift and right click anywhere in the folder, in the popup there will be a option to open command prompt here (if you are using windows 8.1 or lower) or open powershell here (if you are using windows 10) click on it, a black window will appear, paste the below command in that where filename.py is name of the python file you have downloaded.

python filename.py 
  
And now press enter. Voila your python script will now run.
